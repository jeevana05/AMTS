# Automated Metro Transit System

## Project Overview
The Automated Metro Transit System (AMTS) is a database-driven application designed to streamline metro operations, ensuring efficient management of train schedules, ticket bookings, and passenger services. The system supports real-time updates, secure user management, and robust database functionalities to enhance the metro transit experience for passengers and administrators alike.

This project was developed as part of the Mini project for the course DBMS - developed in collaboration with my teammate, Asvith Reddy (@asvithreddy). 
Our main aim was to make the frequency of arrival and departure of trains at a metro station dynamic, while keeping the basic feature such as ticket booking for passengers and adminstrator functionalities for the admins or staff.  
> We have created a mini-world ofsorts wherein trains only operate between 2 stations for ease of implementation in the limited time available (Stations' names are just for representational purposes).
